## About WCS

WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services, is a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution for providing managed Weaviate instances to you, our users.

The Weaviate "core" software library is the same regardless of whether you run Weaviate as a self-deployed solution, or through WCS. 

Through WCS, we aim provide you with the most convenient experience possible with Weaviate. We do this by reflecting in WCS the best practices for running Weaviate on the cloud, and managing the underlying infrastructure so you can focus on using Weaviate to add value to your work.

### Capabilities

Each WCS instance is: 
- Automatically created with the latest version of Weaviate.
- Pre-configured with the `text2vec-cohere', 'text2vec-huggingface', 'text2vec-openai', 'qna-openai' and 'generative-openai' modules.
- User-configurable to use authentication for security.
- (QUESTION) Can a user modify any of the configuration e.g. env variables?

### Infrastructure

WCS is available on AWS, Azure and GCP infrastructure.
- (QUESTION) I saw that the user can choose the region. Can a user choose the infrastructure?
