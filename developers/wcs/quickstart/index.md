## Overview

Welcome to the **Quickstart tutorial** for Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). Here, you will learn how to get set up on WCS with an instance of Weaviate and to instantiate a Weaviate client to communicate with it.

By the time we are finished here, you'll be set up and ready to move onto our Weaviate library Quickstart tutorial if you wish.

### Agenda

By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with basics of WCS. You will have:
- Created a WCS account,
- Created a new free WCS sandbox instance with authentication enabled,
- Installed a Weaviate client of your choice, and
- Queried your new WCS sandbox instance with the Weaviate client.

## Sign in to WCS

1. First, access WCS by navigating to the [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/), and click on "Sign in with the Weaviate Cloud Services".
1. (Optional) If you don't have an account with WCS yet, click on the "Register" button and create a new account.
1. Then, sign in with your WCS username and password.

## Create a Weaviate Cluster

To create a new Weaviate Cluster:
1. Click the "Create cluster" button
1. Select the **Free sandbox** *plan tier*.
1. Provide a *cluster name*, which will become a part of its URL. A suffix will be added to this to ensure uniqueness.
1. Leave the `Enable Authentication` option as `No`.

Your selections should look like this:

Finally, press **Create** to create your sandbox instance. Note that the sandbox will expire in 30 days.

  <summary>Sandbox expiry & options</summary>

import SandBoxExpiry from '/_includes/sandbox.expiry.mdx';

<SandBoxExpiry/>

</details>

This will start the process to create a new instance, and you should see a progress indicator.

Instance creation should take a minute or two, and you should see a tick ‚úîÔ∏è when it's done - indicating that the instance is ready.

In the meantime, let's start installing a client library.

## Install a client library

You can communicate with Weaviate with the available [client libraries](../client-libraries/index.md) (currently available for `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Java` and `Go`) or the [RESTful API](../api/rest/index.md).

import ClientCapabilitiesOverview from '/_includes/client.capabilities.mdx'

<ClientCapabilitiesOverview />

Install your preferred client by following the relevant instructions below:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart.clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

## Connect to your WCS instance

:::warning todo
finish
:::

Click on the `Cluster Id` link, which will open a new page in your browser and display all the available endpoints.

<img src={WCScreate} width="100%" alt="Weaviate Cluster"/>

If you can see this response in your browser, *congratulations!* you have successfully started up an instance of Weaviate. üéâ

:::tip Authenticating with WCS + Weaviate client
If you do enable OIDC in WCS for added security, the easiest way to authenticate as a user is to use the Weaviate client library.

Consult the authentication for your preferred client library and use the "Resource Owner Password Flow" method, by passing on the `username` and `password` you used to sign in to WCS. See the docs below:
- [Python](../client-libraries/python.md#wcs-authentication)
- [JavaScript](../client-libraries/javascript.md#wcs-authentication)
- [Go](../client-libraries/go.md#wcs-authentication)
- [Java](../client-libraries/java.md#wcs-authentication)
:::

## Recap

* You have a working instance of Weaviate in Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS).
* You have installed a client library in your preferred language.
