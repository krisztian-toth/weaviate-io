## Overview

For ensure security in a production environment, WCS instances of Weaviate come pre-configured with authentication enabled (except for sandbox instances, where it is optional).

You can authenticate into a WCS instance through the account owner's WCS username and password, or an API key. There is no difference between the two in terms of the available permissions, so it is up to you to choose one that is most appropriate to your workflow.

:::tip Recommendation: Use the API key
In general, we recommend authenticating with the API key so that your WCS account username and password remains secure.

## Instructions

### Authentication with an API key

To authenticate with Weaviate with an API key, each request header should include:

```json
Authorization: Bearer {Bearer}
```

Where `{Bearer}` is the API key.

This can be further abstracted using a Weaviate client, as shown in the code examples below:

import WCSAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.api.key.mdx';

<WCSAuthenticationApiKey/>

### Authentication with WCS username and password

To authenticate with Weaviate with your WCS username and password, you must obtain an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token, which needs to be then added to each request header as below:

```json
Authorization: Bearer {Bearer}
```

As the token will periodically expire, new tokens must be obtained.

To automate this workflow, we strongly recommend that you use your preferred Weaviate client library for username and password authentication. The relevant code examples for authentication are below:

import WCSAuthenticationUserPass from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.user.pass.mdx';

<WCSAuthenticationUserPass/>
